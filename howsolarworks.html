        <h3>Solar panels</h3>
        <p>A solar panel consists of solar cells. They are made of a material, usually silicon, that only conducts current when light falls on it. As soon as the sun shines on the panel, an electric current is created between the positive charge on
          top of the cell and the negative charge below. That is called direct current.
          An inverter then converts this power into alternating current, which is the same type of power that comes from your wall socket at home. Then the inverter sends the power into the electricity grid, ready to use or to be stored in batteries.

        <h3>Charge controller</h3>
        <p>A charge controller connects the solar panel to the battery. It ensures that the voltage of the solar panel is adjusted downwards close to the voltage level of the battery. The input voltage of a charge controller is then almost equal to
          the voltage of the battery that is connected. It also counts in the voltage loss in cables and charge controller. In times of heavy cloud coverage and rain or intensive load on the battery, the battery voltage may be lower than normal. This
          also has repercussions on the voltage level of the solar panel and this results in less yield.

        <h3>Battery system</h3>
        <p>The battery system uses modern lithium-ion batteries, which are mainly charged with solar power. Only when the battery is empty will power be taken from the energy grid again. It even becomes possible to be completely independent from the
          electricity grid in the spring and summer months. Home batteries are rapidly becoming cheaper with the rise of electric cars. It is therefore not surprising that many home batteries are offered by well-known car brands. Manufacturers such
          as Tesla, Mercedes and BMW already offer home batteries. Although the number of households with a home battery is still small and the price is still high, the home battery will quickly become cheaper and more popular in the coming years.
          An inverter then converts this power into alternating current, which is the same type of power that comes from your socket. Then the inverter sends the power into the electricity grid, ready to use or to be stored in batteries.

        <h3>DC power</h3>
        <p>Direct current, often abbreviated as DC, is an electrical current with constant current direction. Direct current is essential for the operation of almost all
          electronics. Batteries and accumulators supply a DC voltage. DC voltage can be
          generated with solar cells, for example. In most countries the trams, trolleybuses and most trains run on DC voltage. AC voltage can be generated by
          a generator, such as a dynamo. The generators used in power plants also generate AC
          voltage.</p>

      <article id="solarworks-article5">
        <h3>Inverter</h3>
        <p>An inverter is an electronic device that can convert the input voltage to another voltage or convert
          electrical energy into energy of a different frequency.
          In most cases, the voltage generated by a solar panel is not immediately suitable for use. First of all, most household
          appliances are made for AC voltage, although a regular light bulb will also burn fine on DC. In addition, it would be annoying if the fluctuations in light incidence would affect the connected equipment. Solar panels are therefore usually
          connected to the mains, which supplies a constant AC voltage of 230 volts. The solar power thus supplements the electricity from the mains, and vice versa.

      <article id="solarworks-article6">
        <h3>AC power</h3>
        <p>Alternating current abbreviated "AC", flows first in one direction and then the other, continuously changing direction.
          An alternating voltage changes continuously between positive and negative. A swimming pool is therefore very quickly alternately positive and then negative again.
          The speed at which the direction changes is called the frequency of the AC and is in hertz. This is the number that indicates the number of directional periods per second. The electricity that comes from the mains has a frequency of 50 Hz
          in Europe. This means that the alternating current changes direction 50 times per second.
